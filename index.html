        <p><em>Business Writer & Aspiriring Web Developer</em></p>
        <p>I'm a business writer and professional musician. My background is in small business and non-profit operations and development. In 2020 I began studying software engineering with the goal of becoming a full-stack web developer. I love sci-fi.</p>
        </p>
        <!--<p>I began designing, implementing and maintaining web solutions in 2020.
          Before web development, my field was music education and performance.
          In 2020 when the pandemic hit and I became a new parent, I decided it was time to switch careers.
          And before my career in music, I worked in the non-profit sector as a communications and development director
          and later an operations/business manager. I also worked in sales for years as a young adult.
          So I approach web development with a perspective on some the unique challenges that entrepreneurs,
          small businesses and non-profit organizations face when it comes connecting with their clients and stakeholders.-->
